## GitHub Books

Welcome to **GitHub Books**!

**GitHub Books** is an open-source book concept. I know that all engineers are an author inside but don't know where to start. Here is a chance for you to give it a try! You don't even have to publish on your own. **GitHub Books** eases everything for you!

- Contribute the books of others
- Publish a new edition within minutes
- Keep your entire engineering portfolio in the same place: **GitHub**
- Easily navigate within a book

See the very first GitHub book to be inspired: [Essentials of Being a Software Engineer](link)
