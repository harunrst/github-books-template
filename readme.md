# GitHub Books

Welcome to **GitHub Books**!

**GitHub Books** is an open-source book concept to break writing a book into smaller pieces and to make it easier. I know that all engineers are an author inside but don't know where to start. Here is a chance for you to give it a try! You don't even have to publish on your own. **GitHub Books** eases everything for you!

- Contribute the books of others
- Publish a new edition within minutes
- No need to release a complete book, get feedback on your journey
- Easily navigate within a book
- Keep your entire engineering portfolio in the same place: **GitHub**

See the very first GitHub book to be inspired: <a href="https://github.com/harunrst/Essentials-of-Being-a-Software-Engineer-preview" target="_blank">Essentials of Being a Software Engineer â†’</a>

See entry.md for better of the template: [Entry](entry.md)

## How to

1. Create your book repository from this template
2. Remove the readme.md and rename **entry.md** to **readme.md**.
   Edit your content and finish your first edition. Don't forget to leave open doors for your contributors :)
3. Create a release with a proper release tag such as: "the-1st-edition".

## Tips

1. To protect the integrity of the books, follow the suggestions of the author while contributing.
2. Don't be in rush; you can release the initial chapters and get feedback, then move on to the next chapters and edit previous chapters.
3. Don't forget to mention changes and new sections in the release notes in order to give a clear insight into the editions.
4. Add ðŸŒŽ emoji on contribution points to highlight them.
5. Add github-books and book as topics to your repository to be more visible.
6. Disable packages and environments sections from your home page. They are unnecessary distractions.
7. Any contribution and feedback are welcome! Share your experiences :)
